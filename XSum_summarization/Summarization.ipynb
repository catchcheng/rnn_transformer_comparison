So fortunately for us the invasion never happened.\"\\nThe bunker was about 15ft (4.6m) below ground, but has been filled in since the war.\\nHistorian Tom Sykes said: \"These men were signing up to a suicide mission.\\n\"There was no way out for them, they were going to be caught and tortured, they were ready to kill themselves before allowing themselves to be captured.\"\\nThe Auxiliary Units were stood down in 1944 when the threat of invasion was finally lifted.  Churchill's secret army became Churchill's forgotten army.\\n\"We had signed the Official Secrets Act, you see,\" Mr Miners said.\\n\"We would never talk about what we were trained to do. One of my unit was even sent a white feather by someone who thought he was a coward for not going out to fight, but we knew different.\"\\nMr Sykes has campaigned for years to have the work of the Auxiliary Units officially acknowledged.\\nNow they have been granted permission to take part in the Remembrance Day parade at the Cenotaph on Sunday\\nIt is unclear how many of the men who would have made up Britain's resistance army remain alive, but Mr Miners will be making the journey from Perranporth.\\n\"I wish my friends could be there with me,\" he said.\\n\"I wish this could have been done years ago so they could have been there with me but I will march to represent all of them.\"</td>\n",
