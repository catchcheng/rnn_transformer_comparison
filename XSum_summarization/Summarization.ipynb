Now Leith Theatre is about to come of age again.\\n\"The loss of city centre venues and the gentrification of Leith, making it no longer a no-go area for tourists, ensure its development as a city-wide resource is essential. And it is, and will remain, a hub for the local community.\"\\nTrust board member Mike Griffith, a former administrative director of the Traverse Theatre, said: \"It actually took about four years to reach agreement with the city council for us to take on a lease.\\n\"Even after we got into the building there were a whole load of things that we didn't know about.\\n\"The main thing that has happened since then is that repairs have been carried out to the roof by the council to make sure the building is wind and water-tight.\\n\"It will need a bit of a tidy up for the Hidden Door Festival.\\n\"In terms of further work, it's going to be community spirit that gets things going.
